## About Project 

This week we had to make a coding quiz using html, css and java script. The quiz had to include a start page with a start button, a timer that begins when you start the quiz, multiple questions, and the ability to save the high scores with the users initials. 

## Steps I Took To Complete Challenge 

* The first thing i did was create a new repository on GitHub and copy it on to my local machine.

* Then went over the acceptance criteria to make a checklist of the things that needed to be done.

* Then i started bulding my quiz with html, adding the main title, start button, and header elements.

* I made 3 html files. One for my main structure, one for my questions and one for the highscore page.

* I then created a css file to style and polish all of my pages.

* Then i created my java script file to start adding functions to my application like the timer, weather the questions were answered corrctly or incorrectly etc.
